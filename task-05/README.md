I have started this task with arranging buttons and placeholders in search window class. then once search button is triggered, getinfo button is triggered which will fill the detais obtained from the api<br>
If capture is clicked, capture is called which download the image and save the name and picture is downloaded as nameofpokemon.png and the name is added into list captured_pokemon and image is saved into captured_pokemon folder<br>
if display is clicked, display_window is called where if there are no captured pokemons, error is shown else, name is displayed as captured_pokemon[pointer] where pointer is initiaised to 0 and captured_pokemon[pointer].png is displayed. if next or back buttons are clicked, pointer is updated and update_display is called which changes the image and name of the pokemon based on the pointer<br>


here is video of how it worked
