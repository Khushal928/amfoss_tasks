This task sharpened my brain. I enjoyed doing them though i wasted lot of time trying to figure out how to solve part-5<br>
here is how my approach is to first 4 questions<br>
[question 1](./explanations/cp1.md/)<br>
[question 2](./explanations/cp2.md/)<br>
[question 3](./explanations/cp3.md/)<br>
[question 4](explations/cp4.md/)<br>
I could not solve 5th one!
