I have started this task by authenicating my github account with linux terminal(so called local machine). Then I have cloned my local machine with repositories(amfoss-tasks and TheCommandLineCup)

Then for the first two challenges, I have used basic linux commands like cd, ls, cat, nano etc..... 

and then obtained the codes for the next two challenges, I have changed the branch into specified ones and then used given command in repo to change the location of some python files to main branch. then I have obtained the codes for these two challenges by executing the python files and obtained the codes 

after obtaining codes after each of the four challenges, I have entered them in codes directory in amfoss-tasks repository then I have decoded the code with given command and it resulted me a link to a new github repository TheFinalSpell. as specified in README file in this repository, I have cloned this repository and opened a text file in this repo which concluded task-01 

an explaination with terminal commands is in codes directory in amfoss-tasks 

This task helped me on learning Git, understaning Github and some linux commands. I have learned how people with different 'machines' handle same repository at once
