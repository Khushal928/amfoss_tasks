due to some pushing issues, i have to create a new repo(this one) in last minute but this is the [repo](https://github.com/Khushal928/amfoss-tasks) that I pushed my work from dec-27


# Why should we choose you?
*******************
I am Khushal Chitturi, a CS enthusiastic and like to improve myself. But there are lots of things in there and I am not sure what my way is. I want someone to guide me and I want to surround myself with good people and more smarter than me and compete with them. I got introduced with many things while doing these tasks and I want to learn more and dive deep. I have tried my best in solving the challenges consistently. 


# How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
I will try my best to complete whatever work I am given. I have worked really hard during my vacation and i would try my best to consistently improve and make myself usefull to the team and I will always try to learn new things and that process


# What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
*************************************
since I have already said I am not sure what my way is. so i could not plan my journey for more than this semister. my goal is to master web devolopment, introduce my self to DSA and learn java, cpp throughly. I am planing to start doing the course of webdevolopment by cs50 parallelly learning cpp online.


# What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?
**********************************************
These tasks really introduced me with various software technologies and took the best of me. It is like a kickstart to flutter, web devolopment using python, web devolopment using html,css and java script and vulkan!
